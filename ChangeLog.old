	pf/conf/templates/configurator/reg-vlan.conf,
	pf/conf/templates/configurator/zen-vlan.conf: Added vlan.dhcpd and

	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1113

2010-12-10	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm: Code to extract SSID out of RADIUS Access-Request 
	attributes has been properly distributed to AP/Controller modules.

	* Renamed pf/README_SWITCHES to pf/README.network-devices: SWITCHES
	is misleading so it's changed network-device

	pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Juniper EX series Wired MAC 
	Authentication support without Voice over IP
	Side effects:
	- pfsetvlan now handles WIRED_MAC_AUTH properly (instead of as a failed 
	  port-security traps not enabled type)
	- Accidental inclusion of extractSsid() refactoring (will be completed
	  later)

2010-12-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	* pf/addons/802.1X/packetfence.pm,
	pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Now able to detect MAC

	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1075

	* pf/bin/pfcmd_vlan: pfcmd_vlan now logs in logs/packetfence.log like

	scripts

	* Renamed pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl to 
	pf/addons/802.1X/packetfence.pm: Old name didn't bring any added value

	Note in UPGRADE and tests updated.

2010-11-23	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	import. This is what was initially planned.

	* pf/addons/loadMACintoDB.pl, pf/UPGRADE: Dropping loadMACintoDB.pl
	script in favor of new node import facility available on CLI or web
	admin.

	* pf/t/util.t, pf/lib/pf/import.pm, pf/lib/pf/util.pm, pf/t/all.t,
	pf/t/smoke.t: Fixed a very long standing issue: valid_mac and
	clean_mac didn't properly parse xxxx.xxxx.xxxx formatted MACs.
	Also calling clean_mac on node importation allows it to be more
	tolerant on MAC format input. Added tests!

	* pf/html/admin/check_login.php, pf/html/admin/common/adminperm.inc, 
	pf/html/admin/common/helpers.inc, pf/html/admin/common.php: Removed php

	pf/t/data/switches.conf, pf/t/data.t, pf/t/pf.t: New radiusSecret 
	parameter in conf/switches.conf. This allows to automatically configure
	FreeRADIUS' clients.conf (NAS aka client switches or APs). Right now

	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1028

2010-10-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1088

	pf/t/radius.t: pf::radius now verifies if switch supports Wired MAB 
	and 802.1X before processing request.
	Change of default behavior: A request from a switch not defined in 
	switches.conf will fail now. Before we were trying to be nice and load 
	the settings of the default switch but we decided that it wasn't nice 
	for users if they don't realize something wrong first.
	Made test pass and added a couple of them.

	pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t, pf/t/pod.t: Added support for HP ProCurve
	MSM710 Mobility Controller.

2010-10-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: Added HP ProCurve Access Point and
	Controller fingerprints and Ricoh MFP.

	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22: Apache debugging
	instructions. Commented by default only there as a reminder.

2010-10-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/html/admin/node/edit.php: Fixed a regression where node fields 
	coming from locationlog where set to be editable and would cause 
	grammar failure during node editing.

	* pf/addons/proxy-bypass/README, 
	pf/addons/proxy-bypass/squid-redirector.pl, 
	pf/addons/proxy-bypass/squid.conf-sample.patch, pf/cgi-bin/redir.cgi,
	pf/cgi-bin/register.cgi, pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi, 
	pf/html/user/content/index.php, pf/lib/pf/config.pm, pf/lib/pf/web.pm:
	New feature: Client Proxy Interception (proxy-bypass)
	Requires squid and is not useful to everyone so it is in addons but 
	it's easy to install.
	- squid config + redirector script
	- Provided requirements, install instructions and basic troubleshooting.
	- IP lookup code updated in core
	Fixes #1035;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1035

2010-10-01	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Optional auto-registration
	of EAP authenticated devices in order.
	Example code more proper, re-ordered parameters for 
	getNodeInfoForAutoReg to make the interface consistent with other 
	related calls. Last touch on #1002;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1002

	* pf/NEWS, pf/conf/ui.conf, pf/db/pf-schema-1.10.0.sql,

	pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm, pf/lib/pf/pfcmd.pm, pf/lib/pf/radius.pm
	pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Adding dot1x_username and 
	ssid to locationlog and exposing it through node_view and friends. 
	Fixes #995 and #1002;
	Required several changes to the booking aspects of packetfence so it is
	a potentially destabilizing change. Database changes were made also.

	pf/lib/pf/vlan/custom.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener, 
	pf/t/vlan.t: The node table no longer carries duplicated data from 
	locationlog. Fixes #914; 
	As a side benefit the purpose of bypass_vlan is now more clear than 
	only vlan. Fixes #977; 
	pf::node calls still join with the locationlog so the changes are 
	somewhat transparent. Updated all callers. 
	- new locationlog_insert_closed to insert closed entries (used by 
	dhcplogger for option82 enabled packets)
	- cleaner SQL queries
	- locationlog_synchronize no longer needs to keep the node table updated
	- changed default hidden fields and default items ordering in node view
	and edit
	- added default sorting options to node view (related to #820) 
	- no longer setting node.vlan to current switch's vlan in node register
	- pf::vlan no longer needs to handle updated node calls 
	Also misc cleanup and fixes

	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=977

	* pf/addons/loadMACintoDB.pl: Added minimal POD for file and added to 
	minimum test suites

2010-09-28	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Updated files manifest to remove pdp.cgi.

2010-09-27	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Updated documentation
	to reflect the re-worked FreeRADIUS modules using post-auth instead of
	authorize calls.

	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_soap.pl: Using post-auth 
	instead of authorize for the FreeRADIUS module, enables some incredible
	stuff like auto-registration of successful EAP connections, etc. Fixes 
	#1034;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1034

	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl, UPGRADE: Re-worked the 
	module to work on post-auth calls instead of authorize calls. This 
	avoid work being done when the EAP credentials don't even pass and
	improves overall correctness of the system (autoregistration in this
	module is now possible). It can also improve performance in network 
	with a lot of wrong 802.1X requests as they no longer exercise the 
	PacketFence module. Backport of fix #1034 from trunk;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1034

	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: Removed a space in the fingerprints 
	that's causing the Symbian OS to be the universal fingerprint for
	nodes that don't have a fingerprint.

2010-09-24	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl: got rid of an unnecessary
	te1st

2010-09-24	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Added RADIUS User-Name to the 
	method signature of pf::vlan::getNodeInfoForAutoReg. Allows to record 
	the username of a node that would be automatically registered by policy.
	Fixes #1000;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1000

	* Added pf/lib/pf/mod_perl_require.pl, modified 
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22: Pre-loading PacketFence modules
	using a PerlRequire statement. Improves per-request latency and overall
	performance. Thanks to Josh Ward from University of Oregon for the 
	initial research on the fix!

	* Renamed pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi to pf/lib/pf/WebAPI.pm, modified
	pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_soap.pl, 
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22, pf/lib/pf/WebAPI.pm,

	SOAP CGI handler to full blown mod_perl SOAP-Lite hosted module. 
	Fixes #1010; 
	Note: URI for Web Services changed from /cgi-bin/pdp.cgi to /webapi
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1010

2010-09-23	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Fixed a small but important merge mistake.

2010-09-23	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Removed all Logger calls setting shared 'tid' 
	information. First they were redundant since the MDC hash is global and
	second, they are corrupting other places were we could be setting the 
	'tid' (like from a web call).

2010-09-22	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: 1.9.2dev started and removed invalid dependency.
	See #882 for details;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=882

	* pf/NEWS, pf/conf/pf-release,

	pf/t/pfcmd.t: New 1.9.1 release!

	* pf/t/smoke.t: Added new smoke testsuite which is used by our building
	process. A suite of tests quick to run, with no side-effects and that 
	should always pass.

2010-09-21	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt:
	Updated documentation for FreeRadius 1.x and added some for 2.x. 
	Fixes bug #1036;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1036

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt:
	Updated (for clarification purpose) documentation for Cisco stacked

	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=764

	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Enforcing maxnodes the same way in register.cgi 
	and pf::node's node_register. Prevent situations where unregistered 
	nodes would be accounted for when enforcing maxnodes causing errors
	internally but not visible in the captive portal. So this is both a 
	usability and correctness fix. Fixes #1057;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1057

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Added validation for violation grace period
	in violation_trigger. Avoids unnecessary load in certain cases. 
	Fixes #857;

	* pf/cgi-bin/register.cgi, pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22, 
	pf/lib/pf/web.pm, pf/packetfence.spec: Captive portal now using 
	mod_perl. Huge performance gain. Up to 23x faster on some workloads we
	tested. Fixes #879;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=879

2010-09-21	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt:
	Added a section in the performance optimization section regarding 
	blocking non browser requests in the captive portal

	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: New DHCP fingerprints: Cisco,
	Netgear Router, Quanta Microsystems, Debian-based Linux, Nokia Tablet,
	Symbian OS. Thanks to Sam Winotai (from Loyola Marymount University) 
	for the contribution! 

2010-09-20	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>

	pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t, pf/t/pod.t: Fixed the error in the 4500 
	module name (was originally named BayStack 4500 but it is actually ERS
	4500).

2010-09-17	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: Fixed Siemens optiPoint WL2 
	Professional fingerprint.

	* pf/html/admin/common.php, pf/lib/pf/pfcmd.pm: pfcmd's node filters now
	supports arguments with spaces as long as they are double-quoted. 
	Viewing nodes per category on the admin interface was updated to use 
	this facility. Fixes #1056;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1056

	* pf/html/admin/common.php, pf/html/admin/node/view.php: Table 
	refreshes now re-do a count so paging in node table doesn't brake on
	deletions. Fixes #1055;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1055

2010-09-17	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Nortel/ERS2500.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES,

	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php, pf/t/critic.t, 
	pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t, pf/t/pod.t: Added support for Nortel ERS 
	2500 Series.

2010-09-17	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Extreme/Summit.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Extreme/Summit_X250e.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Extreme.pm, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php,
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php: 
	Re-worked port-security (MAC address Lockdown) support and added Voice
	over IP support for Extreme XOS. We removed the CLI requirement making
	it a production ready module. Thanks to Extreme Networks for sponsoring
	the feature and adding features to their ExtremeXOS making this 
	possible.

2010-09-17	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Nortel/BayStack4500.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php,
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php, pf/t/critic.t, 
	pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t, pf/t/pod.t: Added support for Nortel 4500
	Series. This module will replace the one for Nortel 4550 since the code
	is the same for the entire serie.

2010-09-17	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added configuration
	instructions for Extreme in port security and Voice over IP. Module is
	now identified as covering the whole Extreme XOS series and previous
	limitations were removed since the code has been fixed.

2010-09-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/autodiscover.pl, pf/addons/loadMACintoDB.pl, 
	pf/lib/pf/node.pm, pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener, pf/UPGRADE: Removed print 
	statement from node_modify. Placed print statements in all callers that
	cares. This was an important blocker to put the captive portal in 
	mod_perl and to allow our web services back-end in trunk to work 
	reliably. Fixes #1068;
	http://packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1068

	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: node_view, node_view_with_fingerprint, 
	node_view_all now returns empty '' category instead of NULL when node 
	doesn't have a category. This is more consistent with all the other 
	fields. Fixes #1063;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1063

2010-09-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/t/critic.t, pf/t/pf.t, pf/t/pod.t: Added pf::radius and friends to
	the bare-minimal tests (critic, compile and pod). Not sure why they 
	weren't already there...
	
	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm, pf/lib/pf/radius/constants.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/radius/custom.pm, packetfence.spec: RADIUS constants are now 
	in a seperate file preventing odd errors when users override methods in
	pf::radius::custom. Fixes #1001;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1001

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Fixed merge problem introduced yesterday where
	pre-trunk code has been propagated in trunk by mistake breaking the
	build.

2010-09-13	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan/custom.pm: Importing more modules to avoid people using
	custom code that doesn't compile even if they copiedy and pasted from
	pf::vlan. Fixes #1001 for pf::vlan::custom since there are no specific 
	constants defined in pf::vlan.
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1001

	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Sub node_register_auto no longer exported since 
	a while. Removing at the earliest point in trunk branch revno:
	bad6d50ec65bad5779a30d488020eb49acad200d

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Package version bump to 1.10.0 to clearly mark
	a departure from 1.9.x

	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_soap.pl: Added SSID detection 
	for Aruba wireless controllers.

	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: New DHCP fingerprints: Windows,
	Alcatel, Siemens, Cisco, Linksys, Mitel IP phones, Cisco, Enterasys,
	Trapeze APs, Debian, Ubuntu, Puppy Linux, Enterasys Switches, Nokia
	Internet Tablet, HP iLO Agents, APC UPS, Polycom Video conferencing,
	FreeBSD, Eye-Fi Wireless Memory Card, Novell Netware, Apple Netboot,
	more PXE, Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8) and Neoware's thin clients.
	Thanks to Eric Kollmann for the contribution! See his OS/device 
	fingerprinting related work at: http://myweb.cableone.net/xnih/

2010-09-10	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Added logging to highlight the fact that we are
	connecting on a node's previous switch. Will prevent confusing people 
	like me. Fixes #1052;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1052
	Also made some unnecessary whitespace adjustments.. sorry I couldn't 
	resist...

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Fixes to the try {} catch {} syntax. No bug reported 
	but I found out it could be problematic since I was bitten by this 
	when working on the upcoming error handling in pf::SNMP::Extreme.

2010-09-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Aruba.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/Catalyst_2960.pm,

	Cisco (2960, 3550) and Aruba in the SNMP modules

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added configuration
	instructions for Extreme in port security.

2010-09-07	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Extreme/Summit_X250e.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Extreme.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/constants.pm: Added port-security support for Extreme 
	XOS, called MAC Address Lockdown in Extreme's language. It relies on 
	CLI for now so it is not recommended for large networks. Extreme is 
	working on providing a solution for this.

2010-09-03	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/MockedSwitch.pm, pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t: Added
	new exceptions in the tests and implemented new trunk specific subs. So
	that the new tests passes.

2010-09-02	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/MockedSwitch.pm, pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t: New 
	pf::SNMP:MockedSwitch that will be used to test the efficiency of our
	pfsetvlan daemon. Some tests to make sure it stays relevant.

	support I encountered:
	- One crasher (missing sub because of a bad merge)

	- Fixed an unnecessary warning on node_modify

2010-05-04	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	  specified more than once and will give helpful error message (in 
	  logs/packetfence.log).
	- in generate_snmptrapd_conf() we now avoid bad switch with duplicated 
	  IPs
	- pfsetvlan will start even if errors were detected in switches.conf
	- with test case
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=766

	* pf/html/admin/common.php: Regular expression in web admin has been
	losen up so that a logwarn is reported as an error. Fixes 964;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=964

2010-04-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php: Truncated long names.
	Fixes 923;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=923

	* pf/html/admin/login.php: Link on the PacketFence logo on the login
	page now longer links to localhost. Fixes 885;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=885

	* pf/html/admin/status/sajax-dashboard.php: Memory display in the 
	dashboard no longer includes buffers and cache. We were getting too
	many complains about 99% usage when the linux memory manager was doing
	its job right. Fixes #916;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=916

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Foundry.pm: Got port security + VoIP to work!

2010-04-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/Catalyst_2950.pm: Added a note that SNMPv3 
	support doesn't work

2010-04-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/accounting.pl, pf/addons/recovery.pl: hack to make tests
	work successfully in our new build env.

2010-04-08	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener: Fix call to non-existing script lookup_node.pl
	Fixes 858;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=858

2010-04-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Foundry.pm: Fixed a couple of issues with port-security
	and VLAN changes if ifIndex doesn't change

2010-04-07	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Foundry.pm: Port security implementation

2010-04-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Snapshot 1.8.8-0.20100311
	- Added addons/loadMACintoDB.pl to rpm spec

	* pf/conf/pf-release: Version bump to 1.8.8dev (forgot to do earlier)

	* pf/lib/pf/ifoctetslog.pm, pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm: Fixed a context
	issue with database queries related to mac history, switchport history
	and user bandwidth accounting. Also fixed a slight mistake with 
	ifoctet's db queries in general.

2010-04-01	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi: Exception handling in radius authorize so we 
	collect errors in the server logs and in the client logs.
	Also took out CGI::Carp fatalsToBrowser since I've read it's not 
	compatible with mod_perl

2010-03-31	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	Small fixes to issues found during functionnal testing.

	* pf/lib/pf/db.pm: Database is now reconnecting on failed queries

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/ThreeCom/Switch_4200G.pm: Imported bugs and
	limitations section from parent (pf::SNMP::ThreeCom::SS4500).

2010-03-30	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	Lots of small fixes to issues found during functionnal testing.

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Now calling proper 802.1X wired re-authentication
	through pfcmd_vlan
	Also fixed some problems in the parsing of the new traps

	* pf/bin/pfcmd_vlan, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm: Proper 802.1X re-authentication
	pfcmd_vlan's -deauthenticateDot1x now forces re-authentication on wired
	802.1X if an ifIndex is provided on CLI.
	Generic 802.1X re-authentication was done using standard IEEE8021-PAE
	MIB (oid dot1xPaePortReauthenticate).

2010-03-29	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Moved 
	update_node_if_not_accurate out of locationlog because it something
	that people might need to customized. I changed default behavior not
	to call node_modify if node's VLAN field haven't changed.

2010-03-26	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t: fixed some broken tests

	* pf/bin/flip.pl, pf/bin/pfcmd_vlan, 
	pf/docs/MIB/Inverse-PacketFence-Notification.mib, 
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Aruba.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/Catalyst_2960.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/PacketFence.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/lib/pf/radius.pm,
	pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: flip.pl can now handle all Radius connection types
	- modified flip to deal with new connection types
	- added a -deauthenticateDot1x to pfcmd_vlan
	- our local SNMP Traps now carry the connection type (and pfsetvlan 
	  interprets it)
	- Aruba module no longer detects 802.1x on deauth since it's known 
	  when requested now
	- New mechanism to translate NAS-Port to ifIndexes and support for it
	  in the 2960 code
	- pfsetvlan supports new dot1x wireless de-association and issues a 
	  warning on wired dot1x then shut / no shut the port

	* pf/bin/pfcmd,  pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Aruba.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Dlink.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Removed remaining 
	references to hardcoded 'WIFI' ifIndex.

2010-03-24	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/services.pm: PF now creates static routes to routed Vlans 
	when dhcpd is enabled in networks.conf. It used to be when named was 
	enabled.

2010-03-24	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	Minor refactorings all over the place based on review comments

	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: - Graceful recovery if switches.conf is broken
	- Created vlan_determine_for_node and calling the get_xxx_vlan from 
	  pf::vlan
	- Returning radius user is locked return code if vlan_determine_for_node
	  returns -1

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm: Added getVlanByName to resolve VLAN names from 
	switches.conf into VLAN numbers and do appropriate validation and error
	handling. Test case included.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Refactoring pf::vlan according to review
	- custom_getCorrectVlan renamed to get_normal_vlan
	- Pass node_info hashref instead of individual node information to 
	  get_normal_vlan()
	- Now using the new getVlanByName() call
	- Pushed up the testing of the switch object into 
	  determine_vlan_for_node and we are now degrading gracefully if object
	  is wrong
	- Allowing a -1 return from get_normal_vlan to kick out users
	- get_normal_vlan now takes connection_type and ssid as parameters

	* pf/lib/pf/SwitchFactory.pm: Modified the factory so it can produce
	switches of the 'default' type.

2010-03-23	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Refactoring pf::vlan according to review
	- Extracted get_violation_vlan out of vlan_determine_for_node for 
	future use by pf::radius
	- Removing node_exist()/node_add_simple condition: it never happens
	- Extracted get_registration_vlan out of vlan_determine_for_node for 
	future use by pf::radius. Created test case in t/vlan.t too.

	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: Removed code that I realized was run two times
	for nothing (outlined when I did the tests)

	* pf/t/all.t, pf/t/radius.t: Test for pf::radius

	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: Refactoring pf::radius according to review
	- extracted out VoIP handling into its own sub

2010-03-18	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_soap.pl, pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi,
	pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: Client - Server SOAP interface changes
	Now passing a tuple with radius return code and radius reply for radius
	rlm client soap call. Allows greater flexibility of radius answers from
	the server side without modifying clients.
	Reworked all validation and returned codes in rlm_perl_packetfence 
	module.
	Little modifications required to server side components so it'll all 
	work.

2010-03-17	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: A big chunk of pf::radius rework and general
	improvements, hopefully really close to tests

	* pf/lib/pf/actions.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: 
	generalized pf::vlan's shouldAutoRegister and getNodeInfoForAutoReg to 
	work with both pfsetvlan and pf::radius
	Changed all callers

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/t/SNMP.t: minor refactoring: extracted code 
	into isManagedVlan() and some tests against it

2010-03-16	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Fix upgrade bug introduced in 1.8.5: Changed
	perl-Locale-gettext dependency to use the perl namespace version 
	perl(Locale-gettext). Fixes #931;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=931

2010-03-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec, pf/t/vlan.t: Updated vlan tests so that rework
	done in 1.8 branch passes the tests. 
	RPM Spec:
	- Added perl-Test-MockModule as a build dependency (required for tests)
	- Test modules are now required for building instead of required for 
	  package install.

2010-03-11	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Snapshot 1.8.8-0.20100311

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/graph.pm, pf/t/all.t, pf/t/graph.t: Fixed problem 
	introduced in the database improvements concerning graphs
	Added a test case to validate it

2010-03-10	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/accounting.pl, pf/addons/recovery.pl, pf/lib/pf/action.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/class.pm, pf/lib/pf/configfile.pm, pf/lib/pf/db.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/ifoctetslog.pm, pf/lib/pf/iplog.pm, pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/node.pm, pf/lib/pf/os.pm, pf/lib/pf/person.pm,

	pf/lib/pf/violation.pm, pf/sbin/pfdetect, pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener, 
	pf/sbin/pfmon, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/t/all.t, pf/t/data.t, 
	pf/t/config.t, pf/t/person.t: Improvements in the database layer
	- new db_query_execute() that handles retrying queries, rebuilding 
	  prepared statements and better error reporting
	- new way to store db handlers, they are now stored in a hash that expose 
	  them per thread
	- use get_db_handle() to get database handle
	- db_connect no longer has a way to force the preparation of statements
	This all means overall use simplification and better error-handling and 
	reporting.

2010-03-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/dashboard.pm, pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/graph.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm: These files are now a module.

2010-03-05	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Routed VLANs 
	documentation and a schema to explain

	* pf/README_SWITCHES, pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt,
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php, pf/t/SNMP.t,
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/Catalyst_3750.pm, pf/t/critic.t, pf/t/pod.t: 
	Added support for Cisco Catalyst 3750

2010-03-04	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Query optimization (avoid sub-selects)
	Massive improvement of query duration: from a couple of minutes to 
	sub-second on a 25 000 nodes setup.

2010-02-26	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/html/admin/violation/add.php, pf/html/admin/violation/edit.php:
	Fixed a regression where the violation edit page on the web admin would
	not show the violation description properly. Fixes #922;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=922
	Regression introduced in 1.8.4. Cleaning up add.php to use a better
	mechanism to avoid future breakage.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Fixed validation in custom_getCorrectVlan. I was
	testing against a hashref instead of a switch object. Cleaned up the 
	sub to make the normal case obvious.
	Problem introduced in rev 53a220abaf38f45b6b7f9948dd2d365135354fab.

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/t/SNMP.t: Modified generateFakeMac() to allow
	ifIndex larger than two digits to appear in fake MAC. Fixes #921;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=921

	* pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm, pf/lib/pf/node.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm: locationlog and node views are now returning
	the human translated connection_type instead of straight from database
	Also took the opportunity to turn report.pm into a real module.

	* pf/html/admin/common.php, pf/lib/pf/config.pm: Changed the long name
	of the SNMP-based connection type.

	* pf/addons/high-availability/pf-diff, 
	pf/addons/high-availability/rdiff: New sync tools that I've been using
	to compare installations

2010-02-25	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	On the road towards radius and traps unification.
	- Major overhaul of the way we think about nodes: two new fields 
	connection_type and voip
	- Updated all affected components
	
2010-02-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Cleaning up direct MySQL leftovers
	Removing DBI and pf::db deps
	Removed all manual mysql connections

	* pf/lib/pf/action.pm: Minor refactoring: Extracted action autoreg into
	it's own sub.

2010-02-12	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/action.pm, pf/lib/pf/node.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, 
	pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/t/vlan.t: Refactoring
	Merged the different auto-registration mechanisms into node.pm and 
	vlan.pm out of pfsetvlan.
	Removed duplicated code and raw SQL from pfsetvlan. 
	Massive POD doc and refactoring of vlan.pm.
	Updated associated copyrights.

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Report an error to STDERR if the grammar doesn't
	successfully parse the given command. We also include a line # in the
	output so that it will be shown in the Web admin. Fixes #847;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=847

2010-02-11	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Avoided duplicated code, 
	renamed vlan.pm's custom_getNodeInfo to getNodeUpdatedInfo and modified
	it.

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/pfcmd.pm: Allow ! in value field when quoted. Fixes
	#911;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=911

2010-02-10	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22,
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Fixed an apache rewrite rule

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Added validation to custom_getCorrectVlan.
	If the switch object is not correct, return the default VLAN and log a 
	warning.

2010-02-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/recovery.pl, pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, 
	pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/UPGRADE: Avoid loading the entire SwitchFactory 
	at several spots in vlan.pm by passing the switch object around instead 
	of the switch's IP. Improves performance. Fixes #910;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=910

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: When a 'UP' trap is received
	PacketFence will try to get the MAC address 30 times or for 2 minutes 
	whichever condition is first met. Fixes #903;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=903
	
	This prevent the following condition: telnet timeouts take three 
	minutes for the thread to recover so 30 times 3 minutes would hang a 
	thread (and the switch) for 90 minutes. Now since it's longer than the 2
	minutes limit, it only hang it for 3 minutes.

	* pf/lib/pf/web.pm: In web_node_record_user_agent call node_modify() 
	directly instead of pfcmd node edit. It's more performant (avoids 
	spawning a shell) and it'll avoid trying to adjust vlan. Fixes #908;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=908

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Created an ALRM signal handler that report an
	error and does nothing else. This is a workaround to prevent pfsetvlan
	to crash when a Net::Telnet or a Net::Appliance::Session call times out,
	sending a SIGALRM. Fixes #907;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=907 

	Upstream bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=54415

	Local bug to track upstream: 
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=902

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm: Added a noSuchObject test to 
	isLearntTrapsEnabled

2010-02-03	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	the popups without checking return status. Fixes #899;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=899

2010-02-01	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/database-backup-and-maintenance.sh: Added a once-a-month
	archiving of locationlog_history entries older than a year.

2010-01-29	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added documentation
	on how to configure the ISR 1800 with PacketFence and added it to
	the supported switches section

	* pf/NEWS, pf/README_SWITCHES, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php,
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php, pf/t/SNMP.t,

	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/WLC_2106.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/WiSM.pm: 
	Documented an issue with Windows 7 and certain IOSes

2010-01-28	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/t/podCoverage.t: Forcing 100% POD coverage for SNMP.pm since it's
	the base switch module contract and we often don't know what's expected
	when we re-implement subs

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/ISR_1800.pm: getVlan was returning true or false
	instead of requested VLAN, now fixed

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/ISR_1800.pm: More work to support ISR1800 series
	- Implemented getMacBridgePortHash and it relies on CLI :(
	- Implemented _getAllIfIndexForThisVlan (used by getMacBridgePortHash)
	- Added mandatory POD sections

2010-01-27	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/ISR_1800.pm: Implemented isDefinedVlan and
	getVlan for the ISR 1800

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm: Added POD doc

2010-01-26	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Default web admin
	account is not admin / qwerty anymore, it is defined by user when
	running installer.pl. Corrected that mistake in the install guide.

2010-01-22	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Validate for successful write to conf/switches.conf 
	when adding, deleting and editing a switch. Fixes #898;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=898
	Pushed in a little print to logdie conversion at another spot too.
	Hard-coded line numbers are to get the web admin to display the error.

	for CLI transport. Should be set to 'SSH' rather than 'ssh'

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Fixed issues with desAssociate trap for Wireless.
	Threads don't support SSH CLI transport mode. So we fork a call to

2009-11-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl: Rewrite of our freeradius

	longer case-sensitive. Fixes #831;
	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=831

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: performance: verifying if violation already 
	exists in violation_trigger. Improves performance in situation where 
	there are a lot of devices repetively generating violation (ex: blocked
	iPods) because we detect it before launching `pfcmd violation add`.
	Also decreased logging prority from WARN to INFO

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Tighter validation in violation_trigger when
	database query returns a non-empty array (which is a bigger problem yet

	Reported by Josh Ward (he also suggested the fix) Many thanks!

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Parse::RecDescent is a build dependency AND a 
	runtime one. Hopefully fixes #806 for good;
	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=806

	- php-pear-Log is no longer installed by installer
	- Lots of new TODO task for installer

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/pfcmd.pm: Removed use of Log::Log4perl
	This removes a lot of unnecessary build requirements and it wasn't even
	used anywhere in this file. Fixes #826;
	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=826

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Added dependency to enable SNMPv3 AES encryption
	support. Fixes #775; http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=775

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Preparing violation_trigger to handle scan 
	violations
	- new test: scan violation id not authorized in config
	- took out of the trigger id loop various one time tests (inefficient)
	- violation trigger returns 1 if at least one violation is added 0 
	  otherwise
	- bonus POD doc

	* pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi, pf/sbin/pfdetect: Fixed trappable ip test to add
	a violation.

2009-10-21	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfdetect: pfdetect now sends IP when calling violation_trigger
	since the information is already available to it anyway

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Using $bin_dir instead of hardcoded path
	to call pfcmd. Closes a TODO task.

	* pf/lib/pf/scan.pm, pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/lib/pf/trigger.pm: Refactoring
	Moved all scanning code out of pfcmd into a new scan module

	* pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/lib/pf/schedule.pm: Nessus scan integration
	Removed all references of trigger id (tid) regarding scanning

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/help.pm: pfcmd schedule documentation now accurate

	* pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi, pf/html/admin/scan/scan.php:
	Nessus Scan integration
	No more special scans with tid=99999 carrying a special meaning. All
	scanning is done with command line nessus client instead of 
	Nessus::ScanLite (which lacked plugin configuration capabilities). Other
	fixes includes:
	- Removing the 1200001 violation only if one exists (fix a problem when
	  scanning from Web admin)
	- Set HOME= env before calling nessus to conf/nessus/ so the .nessusrc 
	  file is created at a location accessible from CLI and web interfaces
	- Capturing the output of the nessus call and logging it if nessus 
	  returns a non-zero exit code
	- trigger_scan is deprecated
	- Updated web admin accordingly and explicitly disabled scheduled scans

2009-10-20	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/pfcmd_ap.pl: Deleted
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl, pf/addons/802.1X/README:
	Performance improvement in the freeradius PacketFence module
	Merged the content of pfcmd_ap.pl into rlm_perl_packetfence.pl. This 
	avoids costly forks for each radius request.
	Also took the opportunity to add validation of the db handle.

2009-10-19	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/UPGRADE, pf/NEWS: Updated NEWS and UPGRADE with all the work done
	since 1.8.4

2009-10-16	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Improved error-handling in violation_trigger
	Reverted fix in revision 5abfb5911a05dc03e9646eb79a48653155e39278
	because it was too convoluted and replaced it with something clearer.

	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Working Nessus config sample

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Work torwards Nessus integration
	pfcmd now handles by itself the fact that it needs to close the 
	system scan violation if the scan was successfull

	* pf/lib/pf/action.pm, pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Slight logging changes to
	better represent what is actually going on.

	* pf/lib/pf/trigger.pm: trigger_add_scan now follows a contract: returns
	1 if a violation was added by the trigger and 0 otherwise
	a litle POD doc as a bonus

2009-10-16      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/ui.conf:
	* pf/bin/pfcmd:
	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/pfcmd.pm:
	* pf/lib/pf/services.pm: Added the pf_gateway field in networks.conf 
	used to store the PacketFence gateway for a routed VLAN. This is field 
	is only used with routed Registration and Isolation VLANs.
	Added code to allow PacketFence to dynamically create static routes for
	routed Registration and Isolation VLANs. We use the pf_gateway field.

2009-10-16      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Added a fix to show a message when trying to delete a 
	node having open locationlog entries. Fixes #807
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=807

2009-10-15      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/authentication/local.pm: Fixed test to validate if user/pwd 
	is ok for local authentication during registration process. Fixes #779
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=779

2009-10-15      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/web.om: Fixed redir.cgi crash when upgrading useragent. 
	Fixes #782
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=782

2009-10-15      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: "violation not added, no trigger found for.."
	messages too noisy in logs so we decreased log level from INFO to 
	DEBUG. Fixes #812
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=812

2009-10-15      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>

	switch->instantiate(). If it returns 0 then stop executing more code
	and log an error. Fixes #755 and #813
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=755
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=813 

2009-10-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/cgi-bin/redir.cgi: Logging improvement in redir.cgi
	Messages and log priority makes more sense now

2009-10-13	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Increased logging severity for the "Can't
	determine Uplinks for the switch" message (from info to warn).
	The problem is that at this point nothing gets done by packetfence so
	it is rather important to see this message.

	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Added a new UserAgent statement to block
	PSPs

2009-10-13      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.init: Added test in condrestart to check if 
	pfsetvlan.pid exists. If so, restart packetfence. Fixes #805;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=805

2009-10-13      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>

2009-10-13      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Added new dependencies on
	- perl-LDAP (used to authenticate users trough LDAP during registration)
	- php-ldap (used to authenticate users connecting to the Web interface 
	through LDAP)
	- perl-IPC-Cmd (used to generate static routes for registration and 
	isolation routed VLANs)
	- perl-SOAP-Lite (used when receiving alerts from Snort)
	Fixes #798;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=798
	- seting the perl-parse-RecDescent version to 1.94 in order to avoid 
	issues with the newer versions that causes the pfcmd_pregrammar.pm 
	generation to fail. Fixes #806;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=806

2009-10-13	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/pfcmd_ap.pl: In order to avoid unnecessary WIFI entries in
	locationlog (since authentication->reauthentication occurs very often), 
	we don't add new entries anymore if there is already one.i Fixes #788
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=788

2009-10-13	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Updated configuration 
	parameter reference with documentation.conf's changes for 
	trapping.whitelist.

2009-10-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Added device banning templates for iPod 
	touch, iPhone, BlackBerries, PlayStation 3, PSP and Slingbox. 

	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: PlayStation 3 also detects
	PlayStation Portable (PSP)

2009-10-09      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Removed isClientAlive() since we remove the Hub 
	violation that creates too many false positives. 
	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Removed calls to isClientAlive().
	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Removed Hub violation definition.
	* pf/html/user/content/violations/hub.php: Removed this file.
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm: Removed the parsing of c2900AddressViolation
	traps which only purpose what to generate Hub violations.

2009-10-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/web.pm: Changed priority of unknown User-Agent log message
	Was WARN is now INFO which is less scary and makes a lot more sense. 

	* pf/conf/documentation.conf, pf/conf/pf.conf.defaults: Documentation
	for the whitelist parameter is now more accurate.
	
	* pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi, pf/lib/pf/violation.pm, pf/sbin/pfdetect,
	pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener: The validation that the violation is applicable
	is now done in violation_trigger removing duplicate code. Fixes #801;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=801

2009-10-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/rawip.pm, pf/lib/pf/util.pm, pf/sbin/pfmon: Testing for 
	whitelisted_mac is no longer called inside trappable_mac sub.
	Modified callers so they do the test themselves.
	Whitelisting validation was called two times because of that.

	* pf/lib/pf/util.pm: Removed commented code

2009-10-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys/D2.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES: Added support for
	Enterasys Standalone D2 Switch
	It works in linkUp/linkDown mode and port-security (called maclock on
	Enterasys hardware). Talks to the switch using SNMP.

	* pf/README_SWITCHES, pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: 
	Added instructions to setup the D2
	Updated supported switches list

2009-10-05	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	could rely on the bug's behaviour without his knowledge.

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Accton.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Nortel.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm:
	switches.conf's uplink=dynamic is now case-insensitive. Fixes #809;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=809

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Accton.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Nortel.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm:
	Various getUpLinks() subs didn't respect the "return -1 on failure" 
	contract. Fixes #795;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=795

	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22,
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Fixed the omission of a banned
	UserAgent from the https portion of the httpd config. Thanks Regis for
	pointing that out!

2009-10-02	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* Added pf/addons/high-availability/dhcpd-3.0.5-init-script-lsb-fix.patch:
	Little patch to fix LSB compliance of dhcpd's init script. 
	Non-compliant init scripts generate scary error messages in Heartbeat. 

	* pf/conf/log.conf: Logging priority now shown in log files. Fixes
	#771;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=771

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys/SecureStack_C3.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES: Added
	support for Enterasys SecureStack C3 Switch
	It works in linkUp/linkDown mode and port-security (called maclock on
	Enterasys hardware). Talks to the switch using SNMP.
	
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added instructions to
	setup the SecureStack C3
	Updated supported switches list
	Added comments about cleanup to do
	Minor formatting / whitespace cleanup

2009-09-28	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys/Matrix_N3.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES,
	pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added support for
	Enterasys Matrix N3 Switch (Chassis)
	It works in linkUp/linkDown mode and port-security (called maclock on
	Enterasys hardware). Talks to the switch using SNMP.
	Documentation on how to configure was added to the admin guide.

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys.pm: Fix for maclock support (Enterasys' port
	security): Trap string had a typo in parseTrap()

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Fixed a typo in a comment

2009-09-24	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Clarification of the
	vlan parameter in violations.conf

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: New switch config
	Added configuration information for SMC TigerStack 6224M. Thanks to
	Chinasee B. <chinasee.b@psu.ac.th> who provided his config.

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Crash fix
	If we attempted to trigger a violation but no trigger for the violation
	existed, we still tried to move on and add the violation which caused
	the use of a 0 in an hash reference thus a crash.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Fix a crash that happens if violation classes are
	corrupted and a vlan change is required (like when a violation is
	created)

2009-09-16	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

2009-09-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* Renamed pf/addons/high-availability/named-init-script-lsb-fix.patch
	to pf/addons/high-availability/named-9.2-init-script-lsb-fix.patch:
	bind 9.2 exposed wrong behavior but bind 9.3 is fine and patch doesn't
	apply anyway

2009-09-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/high-availability/mysqld-init-script-lsb-fix.patch, 
	pf/addons/high-availability/named-init-script-lsb-fix.patch: LSB 
	compliance patches for MySQL and Bind

	* pf/addons/database-backup-and-maintenance.sh: Added basic database
	maintenance and backup script

	* pf/addons/logrotate: Added a basic logrotate sample script for 
	packetfence

2009-09-11	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22 and 
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Block misbehaving User Agents
	Block at the apache level some User Agents that we don't care about
	such as Windows Update, etc. We give them a 403 error (forbidden).
	Fixes bug #790;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=790

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm: Deactivated port security on Linksys
	Known to be broken and the telnet code was sending SIGALRM and crashing
	pfsetvlan.
	Also added some trace level logging statements. Fixes bug #797;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=797

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: pfsetvlan stops on SIGALRM signal
	Die is properly sent to log4perl. No more misterious stops without any
	error. Alarm signals are known to be buggy with threaded perl. Fixes 
	bug #796;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=796

2009-08-25	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Install Guide updated
	Details
	- version bump
	- yum update before rpmforge install
	- removed priorities requirement (not sure about this one)
	- updated installation procedure to reflect new yum repo
	- re-generated ToC so that updating the table works with OpenOffice 3.1
	- added index links to the ToC elements, it now creates a linkified PDF
	- switch setup now points to the Admin Guide for more switch config
	samples and supported devices list
	- re-org: switches definition before custom trap handling functions 
	since pf's new behavior is based on switch definition rather than 
	per-node
	- explained new correctVlan behavior
	- modifed switches definition to outline the fact that vlan number can
	be overloaded in a specific switch from the default
	- some minor prettification
	- mentionned new support packages and added meat in commecial support 
	section


2009-08-19	Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Renamed CHANGES to NEWS and updated the spec
	file to reflect this change
	* packetfence.spec and
	pf/docs/MIB/Inverse-PacketFence-Notification.mib
	Modified to use support@inverse.ca as the contact information
